# 📦 Custom Planned Function: Sales Order Picking for Mobile WMS

This repository contains two examples of a **custom Planned Function** for Mobile WMS in Dynamics 365 Business Central.

## 🚀 Examples Included

### 1. Functional Example
The active example demonstrates how to register `"Qty. To Ship"` on basic **Sales Order Picking** documents.

### 2. Barebones Example
A minimal illustrative version that demonstrates the mobile logic without enhancements. Intended for educational purposes or as a starting point for custom development.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Do NOT use both examples simultaneously.**
- After publishing your Planned Function, you **must run** the action **"Create Document Types"** in **Mobile WMS Setup**.  
  This step is required to generate the necessary Mobile Messages and Mobile Document Types.
- For best practices and deeper integration, refer to the source code (https://university.taskletfactory.com/) in the following Codeunits:
  - `MOB WMS Receive`
  - `MOB WMS Pick`
