## Introduction
This extension provides a simple example of an ISV Shipping Connector<p>

It uses the Pack & Ship API to transfer data from Pack & Ship into a simple Transport Document based on License Plates.<br>
Intended to be used as a base for building your own connector for any shipping provider solution.

This 'ISV Shipping Connector' must be used together with the sample 'ISV Shipping Solution' extension, also available on github.<br>
